# John Conway's Game of Life
![The running simulation](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/stefano-lupo-blog-photos/game-of-life/GameOfLife.gif)
I made this game of life simulator in Processing one Sunday afternoon. I initially was just making it for fun but then I remembered you can compile the Java code into Javascript with Processing.js so I decided to make it interactive with HTML buttons and stick it on my website for any one who is bored and looking to kill 20 seconds...

See [my website](http://stefanolupo.tech#game-of-life) for a live demo!   
Or, check out [my blog post](http://stefanolupo.tech/blog/2017/10/17/GameOfLife/) for a detailed write up on how it all works!
