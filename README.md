# John Conway's Game of Life
I made this game of life simulator in Processing one Sunday afternoon. I initially was just making it for fun but then I remembered you can compile the Java code into Javascript with Processing.js so I decided to make it interactive with HTML buttons and stick it on my website for any one who is bored and looking to kill 20 seconds...

See [my website](http://stefanolupo.tech#game-of-life) for a live demo!
